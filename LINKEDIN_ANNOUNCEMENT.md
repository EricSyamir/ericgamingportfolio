🎮 Just Launched My Interactive 2D RPG Portfolio Game! 🎮

Let me be honest - I've hated front-end development all my life. Give me backend logic, APIs, databases, machine learning models any day. But front-end? CSS positioning nightmares, responsive design headaches, and browser compatibility issues? No thank you.

But here's the thing - I decided to challenge myself, and this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my coding journey.

I've just launched my NEW interactive portfolio website - a full 2D RPG game built from scratch using Kaboom.js! 🚀

**What makes this special?**

Instead of the typical scroll-through portfolio, visitors can:
- 🎯 Explore my achievements by walking around a pixel-art world
- ⚔️ Battle slimes in combat zones (yes, there's actual combat mechanics!)
- 💬 Interact with objects to learn about my projects, skills, and experience
- 🏆 Compete on a leaderboard system

**The Technical Challenge:**

Since this wasn't your typical web project, I had to build custom tools:
- 🗺️ A **Map Editor** - Custom HTML5 canvas tool for designing the game world, placing objects, and defining combat zones
- 🎨 A **Sprite Viewer** - Interactive sprite selector to browse and debug all 1,200+ game sprites with pixel-perfect precision
- 🎵 Dynamic music system with smooth transitions between background and combat themes
- 📱 Full mobile support with touch controls and responsive UI

**Tech Stack:**
- Kaboom.js (2D game engine)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas
- Custom tooling and game systems

**💡 Best Experience:** This site is optimized for Chrome! While it works on other browsers, Chrome provides the smoothest gameplay experience.

This project forced me to think outside the box, learn game development concepts, and actually enjoy front-end work (who knew that was possible? 😅). Sometimes the best learning happens when you step out of your comfort zone.

Check it out and let me know what you think! Feel free to explore, battle some slimes, and see if you can top the leaderboard! 🏅
